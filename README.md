# FindDistance
This code uses Google Maps API for getting distance and driving time from an initial point to another.
1. This code is only for Python.
2. You need an API key. 
3. There is a maximum number fo queries. You can bypass this by creating another key or paying for the premiun service.
4. There are 2 functions wich I define: "finddist" and "findtime"
5. If the initial point is far away from a road, there is an exit plan: the code looks for the nearest road in an specific radius.
